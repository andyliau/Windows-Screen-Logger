### Files Modified
- **Program.cs** - Added using statement for Installation namespace
- **MainForm.cs** - Added using statement for Installation namespace
- **SettingsForm.cs** - Updated to use Installation namespace classes
- **WindowsScreenLogger.csproj** - Added embedded resources for scripts

### Files Moved
- **SelfInstaller.cs** - Moved from root to Installation/ folder
- **README-SelfInstall.md** - Moved from root to Installation/ folder
- **REFACTORING-SUMMARY.md** - Renamed and moved to Installation/ folder

## Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Separation
- **ALL** installation-related code is now in the Installation folder
- Core application logic is cleanly separated from installation logic
- Clear namespace organization (`WindowsScreenLogger.Installation`)

### 2. Organized Documentation
- All installation documentation in one location
- Clear component documentation in Installation/README.md
- Feature documentation in Installation/README-SelfInstall.md

### 3. Embedded Resources
- Scripts are embedded in the executable as resources
- No external file dependencies for installation functionality
- Fallback scripts if resource loading fails

### 4. Improved Architecture
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Better maintainability and testability
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Installation Namespace Classes

### Core Classes
- **SelfInstaller** - Main orchestrator for installation/uninstallation
- **WindowsAppsRegistry** - Handles Windows Apps & Features registration
- **StartupRegistry** - Manages Windows startup functionality
- **UninstallScriptManager** - Manages and executes uninstallation scripts

### Resources
- **UninstallScript.bat** - Embedded batch script for delayed deletion
- **UninstallScript.ps1** - Embedded PowerShell script for delayed deletion

## Benefits Achieved

? **Complete Organization**: All installation code in dedicated folder
? **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
? **Better Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
? **Comprehensive Documentation**: All docs in one location
? **Modular Design**: Each component can be tested independently
? **No External Dependencies**: Everything embedded in executable

The installation system is now completely organized, maintainable, and self-contained!
